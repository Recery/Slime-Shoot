This is the official repository of Slime Shoot, a game that I'm making in godot. You can do whatever you want with this: Use the assets, use it as reference, make your own Slime Shoot...
I consider this game as a piece of art, so I want to reach the most people I can. It doesn't have any commercial purposes, just the purpose to share what I'm doing and to make people have a good time with it.

Just don't use the music of the game since most of it isn't mine.

And credit is not needed, but DON'T CLAIM things from here as yours (Except you're one of the music artists that composed one of the themes of the game, of course)
