This is the official repository of Slime Shoot, a game that I'm making in godot. You can do whatever you want with this: Use the assets, use it as reference, make your own Slime Shoot...
I consider this game as a piece of art, so I want to reach the most people I can. It doesn't have any commercial purposes, just the purpose to share what I'm doing and to make people have a good time with it.
Just don't use the music of the game since most of it isn't mine.
